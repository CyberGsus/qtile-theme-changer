# qtile-theme-changer

This will eventually become a gui theme changer for qtile themes. These themes are inspired in [antoniosarosi/dotfiles](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles) theme layout.

## Prerequisites

1. The program must be able to read color patterns from images using a color configuration paired with that image.
2. The program must be able to write a color pattern on an image given a color configuration and sizes of the image.
3. The program must let you load a complete theme from a directory and change it.
4. The program should let you create a complete theme from scratch, and save it on a directory.
5. The program should be able to index your themes from a directory, and display them as a list of available themes.
6. Last but not least, the program should provide a qtile command API for automated theme changing.
